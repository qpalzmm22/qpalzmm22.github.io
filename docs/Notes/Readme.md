# How to Read my notes

1. First of all, these notes are made primarily for me.
2. In case you want to read my notes, you need to understand that
>1. there are lots of my thoughts and ideas involved, and
>2. it's always better to check the official document. I myself, also try to do so if possible. I usually reference blogs when I didn't understand completely after reading official documents. The referenced blogs are there to help me. 
4. If you have any question, objection, found mistakes or errors, please be a [good samaritian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parable_of_the_Good_Samaritan) and let me know.
5. Enjoy!
