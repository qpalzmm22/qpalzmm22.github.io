## How to Read my notes

---


---

1. First of all, these notes are made primarily for me.
2. In case you want to read my notes, you need to understand that 1. there are lots of my thoughts and ideas involved, and 2. it's always better to check the official document. I try to do so if possible.
3. If you have questions, objections, found mistakes and errors, please be a [good samaritian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parable_of_the_Good_Samaritan) and let me know.
