# 28

When I tried to solve it, the problem was already solved...
I think someone embeded `.htaccess` file to every directory?

Anyways, proper way to solve it is to embed `.htaccess` file that has content of `php_flag engine off` because apache executes php files. Simply turn off the engine for it to start when we try to read it.
